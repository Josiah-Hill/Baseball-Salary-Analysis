## Title
**An ML project evaluating the salary decisions made by professional baseball teams.**

### Motivation
Determining a fair salary for baseball players is complex, with negotiations influenced by various performance and non-performance metrics. This project aims to quantify the relationship between performance and salary, offering a data-driven approach to salary predictions. Understanding the dynamics behind player salaries is crucial for team management, player agents, and the players themselves. It helps in making informed decisions, ensuring fair compensation, and maintaining competitive balance in the league. Machine learning provides the tools to analyze large datasets, uncover patterns, and predict outcomes. A regression model will be trained to convert the known features of each player into their expected salary.

### Results
